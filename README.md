In accordance with
  [*lex Lyubomiricus,*](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~sslyu/lex.html)
  this repo
  is the single source of truth
  for the UW PLSE portion
  of the 3LA project's
  PLDI push.

[`run.sh`](run.sh)
  should be a readable script
  which runs
  all components of the evaluation.
All components
  of the evaluation
  should be version-controlled
  (e.g. by pointing to specific commits
    using git submodules.)
The entire repository
  is built and tested
  nightly
  on GitHub's machines
  and our own.
